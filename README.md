<h1>Web Application Deployment with Terraform and TicTacToe Game</h1>
Introduction
This project aims to provide a hands-on introduction to deploying a web application using Terraform on AWS. By following the instructions, you'll provision an EC2 instance with Nginx, create a security group for HTTP traffic, and deploy a static website (TicTacToe game) on an S3 bucket.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account
AWS CLI configured with your credentials
Terraform installed on your local machine
Setup and Deployment
Follow these steps to set up and deploy the infrastructure:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Step 2: Initialize Terraform
Initialize the Terraform configuration:

sh
Copy code
terraform init
Step 3: Apply Terraform Configuration
Apply the Terraform configuration to provision the resources:

sh
Copy code
terraform apply
Confirm the creation and update of resources by typing yes when prompted.

Step 4: Upload TicTacToe Game to S3
Sync your TicTacToe game files to the S3 bucket:

sh
Copy code
aws s3 sync tictactoe/ s3://my-static-website-tictactoe-game-first/
Step 5: Access the Web Application
After the deployment, you can access your TicTacToe game using the S3 bucket's website endpoint:

vbnet
Copy code
http://my-static-website-tictactoe-game-first.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
